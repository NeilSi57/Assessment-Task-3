    "The idea of the game is very engaging it involves a popular superhero spiderman, and his villains which all appeal to kids between the ages of 10 - 18. The idea of boss fights and exploring the city and new places give kids a brand new and engaging exprence\n",

    "The game can improve hand-eye coordination, motor skills,  and quick thinking skills which are useful for younger kids. This can be useful to them in the future as it helps with catching and throwing skills and the motor skills help overall physical development and balance, and quick thinking skills can be useful in sports. This can all be proven as games constantly require you to look and screen so you need to know where all the controls are. The motor skills can be proven as they require precise and smooth movement. Games help quick thinking skills as in boss fights you need to use your knowledge in the game to quickly find ways to beat the \"boss\"\n",
